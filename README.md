# Global-Sky-Watch

"Global-Sky-Watch" is an open-source initiative that involves using Raspberry Pi-based cameras installed in participant's backyards to monitor the sky for possible Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), also known as unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The project would includes the software, STL files (for 3D printing of the actual housing) and the hardware specifications and plans necessary to build a complete Global-Sky-Watch system.

The system will use AI-based movement tracking to detect and record any anomalies in the sky that may indicate the presence of UAP or other general "space related activities". Currently the footage captured by the cameras is stored on the Raspberry Pi and can be accessed remotely by the user for further analysis and investigation. Ultimately it would be ideal to have a single system that puts all of the video together and have a "sky map" of all sky activity at any given time.

Global-Sky-Watch is an affordable and accessible solution for individuals who are interested in space and UAP research and investigation. The open-source nature of the project encourages collaboration and sharing of data among communities, including UAP researchers and enthusiasts. 

The project will also record additional aeriel events and can also be used to capture other celestial events like meteor showers and the northern lights.
